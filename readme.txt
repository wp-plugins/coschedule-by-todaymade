== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is CoSchedule? =

CoSchedule is a content marketing editorial calendar that syncs with your WordPress blog using a WordPress plugin.

It helps you visualize and plan your blog content with drag-and-drop ease. You can create and publish customized messages for your social networks for each blog post. Posts are easily moved, and social messages attached to those posts move with them. You can collaborate with your writing team and delegate tasks surrounding your blog posts. Learn more [here.](http://coschedule.com/help)

= How does CoSchedule work? =

After you sign up for an account at CoSchedule.com, you can connect your WordPress blog to your CoSchedule account. You will then have access to the calendar and team features at CoSchedule.com.

CoSchedule synchronizes your WordPress post, author, and category information to its servers, but all of your WordPress data remains in WordPress. CoSchedule will update that WordPress data as you direct, but the data always remains in WordPress. Social messages, tasks, comments, team members, and other data you create in CoSchedule will be stored on CoSchedule's servers, and never in WordPress.

= Why do I need CoSchedule? =

Managing a team blog or planning your own blog's content marketing is not easy inside of WordPress.

CoSchedule is an all-in-one editorial calendar that makes it easier to create, move, and manage your blog posts and stay ahead of your plan. It allows for WordPress blogging team collaboration without needing extra outside tools and logins, reducing the time and unnecessary complexity required to plan your blog's content marketing program. The lightweight plugin allows CoSchedule to work without unnecessary burden on WordPress, which is different that WordPress-oriented plugins like Edit Flow.
